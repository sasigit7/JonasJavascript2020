<!-- 
    Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the 
    calculations! 
    Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
Your tasks:
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their fullname, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI(the same method on both objects). 
   Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method
3. Log to the console who has the higherBMI, together with the fullname and the respective BMI. 
   Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!"

   Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
